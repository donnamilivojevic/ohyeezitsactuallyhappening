            We fell in love with this place as soon as we stepped in this amazingly beautiful old house that were built in 1909-1911 by Klas Fåhraeus with help from Carl Westman, who also drew Röhsska museum and Stockholm Townhall. The building became to be described as Sweden's most beautiful home and a tempel for Fåhraeus great collection of sculptures and easel art.

    Klas Fåhraeus surrounded himself with that time swedish cultural elit and amongst his friends you would find names such as the publisher Karl Otto Bonnier, the writes Ellen Key and painters such as George Pauli and Richard Bergh.

    Fåhraeus assets were mainly placed in stocks and by the time of the recessions in the 1920's, his economy was so low that he was forced to sell Högberga Gård at the age of 63.

    The art collection was sold on an executive auction, except for the "proposal" by Gottfried Kallstenius, that still hangs on the wall at Högberga Gård. Fåhraeus lived his last year withdrawn from social life with his wife in Uppsala.

    In autumn 2010 Högberga Gård opened up a wine factory called Högberga Vinfabrik. They were then the first in Sweden to make wine with grapes from Tuscany. In September 2010 Högberga Gård travelled down to Maremma, Tuscany and pluck 10 tons of grapes in the varieties of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The grapes were then transported in a refrigerated truck to Lidingö where the wine growing and oak barring took place.
