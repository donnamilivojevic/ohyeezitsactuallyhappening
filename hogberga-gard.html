                        <p>We fell in love with this place as soon as we stepped in this amazingly beautiful old house that
                            was built in 1909-1911 by Klas Fåhraeus with help from Carl Westman, who also drew Röhsska museum
                            and Stockholm Townhall. The building became to be described as Sweden's most beautiful home and
                            a temple for Fåhraeus' great collection of sculptures and easel art. Klas Fåhraeus surrounded
                            himself with that time swedish cultural elit and amongst his friends you would find names such
                            as the publisher Karl Otto Bonnier, the writes Ellen Key and painters such as George Pauli and
                            Richard Bergh.</p>

                        <p>Fåhraeus assets were mainly placed in stocks and by the time of the recessions in the 1920's, his
                            economy was so low that he was forced to sell <a href="http://hogberga.se/en">Högberga Gård</a> at the age of 63. The art collection
                            was sold on an executive auction, except for the "proposal" by Gottfried Kallstenius, that still
                            hangs on the wall at Högberga Gård. Fåhraeus lived his last year withdrawn from social life with
                            his wife in Uppsala.</p>

                        <p>In autumn 2010 Högberga Gård opened up a wine factory called Högberga Vinfabrik. They were then the
                            first in Sweden to make wine with grapes from Tuscany. In September 2010 Högberga Gård travelled
                            down to Maremma, Tuscany and pluck 10 tons of grapes in the varieties of Cabernet Sauvignon and
                            Sangiovese. The grapes were then transported in a refrigerated truck to Lidingö where the wine
                            growing and oak barring took place. In autumn of 2011 the first 7500 bottles were ready. And
                            then it was time again. New journey and 11 tons of new grapes that also went thru the whole wine
                            making proccess in their wine factory. Autumn of 2012 they also brought back the grape Merlot
                            as a new and exciting addition to the wine factory, later on came Malvasia Nero. From then on
                            the success story has only continued...</p>
